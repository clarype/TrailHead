                <p>
                    The purpose of this story map is to show and tell the adventures that my girlfriend and I go on with
                    Finn the dog. Most of these trip so far have taken place in oregon, but I hope to expand them to the
                    Pacific NorthWest as time goes by. I'm an geology and geospatial scientists and I love combining
                    technology and recreation to make maps of all kinds of things. This is really just another way to
                    help me learn about web mapping and programing languages. It is also a great way to show fellow
                    hikers an in depth view of these trails. The images are georeferenced to the markers on the map. That
                    each image was taken at the coordinates represented by the marker on the map. Each of these trails have
                    been track by GPS with error not exceeding 12 meters so if you use the data keep that in mind. I’m going
                    create links with KML or GPX file so people can upload the data to there own GPS receiver. This is a
                    work in progress and continues to evolve, and I hope you enjoy it as must I do.

                    The hike to Jorn Lake is approximately 7 miles into the Jefferson Wilderness in the Cascade Range of
                    Oregon. It's not a difficult trail when clear, but I advise to contact the local forest service
                    about trail conditions, for we encountered down trees that made the a large portion a jungle gym.

                    The hike to Lake of the Woods is a 5 mile hike into the Jefferson Wilderness in the Cascade Range
                    of Oregon. It covers some of the same route we took on the Jorn Lake trip, but once we got to
                    Marion Lake we head northeast. Once again check with local forest service about trail conditions,
                    for snowpack covered large areas of the trail which made it more of an adventure.

                    The hike to summit lake is about 4.5 miles from the Pacific Crest trail access on hwy 20.
                    In my opinion this hike is the best bang for your buck, it’s relatively short, the overall ascent
                    is low and the views are spectacular. However, the turnoff to summit lake was a little hard to find.

                    The hike to Mirror Lake is about 8 miles from the Two Pan trailhead in the Eagle Cap Wilderness
                    of Northeastern Oregon. What a place Eagle Cap is, it reminds me of the Sierra Nevadas and the
                    hike was so awesome it gave me a heart attack, for real. 8 miles into the wilderness I had a heart
                    attack, and I walked out thinking it was altitude sickness.

                <p>
                    This hike is about 2.5 miles long off the North Fork of the Saint Joe River. The Path is a multi-use
                    trail for hikes, horses and dirt bikes. This was a day hike to reach a lookout station on Arid Peak.
                    However, due to some bad trail information we miss judged the trail length and turn around halfway
                    there. The Name is derived from the steep slope of the overall trail.
