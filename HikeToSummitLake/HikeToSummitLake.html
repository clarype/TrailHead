                <h1 class="page-header">Hike to Summit Lake</h1>

                <p> We took the hike to Summit Lake which is the closets lake on the south side of Three Finger Jack.
                    The trails follows the Pacific Crest Trail for about four miles, and then splits off for last half a
                    mile on an unimproved trail which was a little hard for us to find. We ended up passing the turn and
                    trail blazed to a cliff that over looks Summit Lake, but with some perseverance and back tracking
                    we found a route to Summit Lake. Overall, the hike was a nice short trek with some spectacular
                    views.

                <h2>The Start</h2>

                <p> The trail head is an access point to the Pacific Crest trail off highway 20. We were thinking of
                    bring our drone but apparently the wilderness area is a no drone fly area. The parking lot was full
                    of horse trailers so expect to encounter horses on the trail. This trail head has the usual parking
                    fee and wilderness pass that is on site self issue.

                <h2> Old Volcanoes</h2>

                <p> The trail begins to level out where the forest of burnt trees meets with current tree line. The
                    burnt trees allow for an awesome view of the surrounding terrain. One reason I like back-packing
                    the Cascades, Volcanoes. They are good at blowing up and make the horizon more interesting.

                <h2> This Is Why I Hike!</h2>

                <p> About four miles is a flat section that cuts across a steep side of the bottom of Three Finger Jack.
                    A little ways up the trail from here is where the trail splits so keep your eyes peeled for trails
                    on the right side. If your bearing after this point on the Pacific Crest becomes West you have gone
                    to far and missed the turn. We found several different trail fragments that seem like a part of
                    broken network of trails to the lake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The steep slope gives the best view of the trek showing once again, Mt Washington, the Sisters,
                    and Mt. Bachelor may be back there somewhere with Black butte on the far left. The Two lake below
                    Black
                    Butte in the image are Martin and Booth Lakes which are accessed by the second intersection at the
                    beginning of the trail.

                <h2> Summit Lake</h2>

                <p> After four and half miles, along with a few detours, we made it to Summit Lake. The lake was
                    cold as expected, sadly no fish. But due to the aloofness of the trail no other hikers
                    were there.
