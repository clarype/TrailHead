                <p align="center">
                    The hike into the Eagle Cap Wilderness was a learning experience to say the least. The hike to
                    Mirror Lake is about 8 miles of one magnificent landscape. The U-shaped valleys that were formed
                    from glaciers remind me of walking through Glacier National Park or Yosemite. The area was once a
                    granitic batholith that solidified and was uplifted. Interestingly, as we were walking up we could
                    see what look like basaltic flows, do to there column features, on top of a granitic outcrop at
                    the top of a ridge. Furthermore, there were dark section of rocks that cut through the granitic
                    rock.
                    These could have been some sources for those lava flows. However, these are just observational
                    extrapolations. If conditions were different and I was not having a heart attack I would have
                    got some samples.

                    River Crossing
                </h2>

                <p align="center">
                    As with most trailheads there is a parking fee and a self issue wilderness pass at the Two Pan
                    trailhead. The beginning of the Lostine trail as a moderate ascent to this point then levels out
                    till the next marker. The river crossing as seen in the image has a will built bridge; however,
                    Finn was a little unsure about crossing.

                <p align="center">
                    Slightly before this marker and a little ways after as seen on the map is the largest switchback
                    section of the whole trail. We found several signs of horses, so as always keep yourself aware of
                    your surroundings especially in this steep rocky switchback sections.

                <p align="center">
                    This point is the beginning of the sweet waking section. It pretty flat for about 2 miles beyond
                    this
                    marker. To our surprize this was our first glimpse of Eagle Cap. Finn was happy in the change of
                    scenery as well.

                <p align="center">
                    Even though it was flat, Eagle Cap looked so far away. Finn was ready set up camp. If you look
                    at the image the tree covered rise just below Eagle Cap (the peak) is the last ascent to Mirror
                    lake. I was hoping to see some wildlife, but there was a lot people on the tail, do to the
                    eclipse and all that.

                <p align="center">
                    With the Mirror Lake in site it was time to find a place to set up camp which should be easy,
                    but everyone and their friends decide to up to Mirror Lake. So we decided to truck on a little
                    further, but it was worth it.

                <p align="center">
                    Finn started to trail behind he was so tired but did great considering it was a 8 mile hike.

                    After poking around the lake Katie found a sweet spot with an great
                    view. We set up our hammocks and enjoyed the view. Oh yeah I had a
                    heart attack the next day, but walked out thing it was altitude sickness.
